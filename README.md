There are three ways of executing our program:

If we want to draw the maze in the console:
      console <<rows>> <colums>

If we want an image of the maze, if we click on the save button, png and json files of the maze are going to be save in the execution directory.
      image <rows> <colums>

If we want to generate a maze from a json file. If we click on the save button, png and json files of the maze are going to be save in the execution directory.
      json <"path of the json file">
